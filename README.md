# 🛡️ Fraud Prevention Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using advanced machine learning algorithms. It includes two trained models (`XGBoost` and a `Stacked Ensemble`) along with Python code for making real-time predictions. The models are trained on transaction data and optimized for high accuracy and recall.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `fraud_stack.pkl` – Stacked ensemble model (high accuracy)
- `fraud_xg.pkl` – XGBoost model (fast + accurate)
- `predict.py` – Python script to load models and make predictions
- `README.md` – Project documentation

---

## 🚀 Quick Start: How to Use the Model

```python
import joblib

# Load pre-trained model
model = joblib.load("fraud_stack.pkl")

# Example input (replace with actual features)
input_data = [[1200.50, 1, 0, 300.0, 100.0, 0.75]]

# Predict
prediction = model.predict(input_data)
print("Prediction:", prediction)

# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sagar1100-star/Fraud_prevention_using_ml.git
cd Fraud_prevention_using_ml

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt  # (if requirements.txt is added)

# 3. Run your prediction script
python predict.py

## 📌 How to Run Locally

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sagar1100-star/Fraud_prevention_using_ml.git
cd Fraud_prevention_using_ml

# 2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt   # Add this file if not already there

# 4. Run prediction script
python predict.py
